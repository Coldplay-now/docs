This page walks you through one full Mintlify workflow from local preview to GitHub push.

## 1) Run local preview

Make sure your docs repo contains `docs.json`, then start Mintlify locally:

```bash
mint dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and keep this process running while you edit pages.

## 2) Make a small docs change

Create or update any `.mdx` page. Keep the first change simple so you can focus on the workflow:

- Update one sentence
- Add one command example
- Save and verify the change in local preview

## 3) Commit your change

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: update getting started content"
```

If Git asks for identity, configure it once:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## 4) Use SSH for GitHub push

If HTTPS push fails, switch your remote to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OWNER/REPO.git
ssh -T git@github.com
git push
```

After SSH is configured, future pushes usually work without entering credentials.

## 5) Verify deployment

Once pushed to your default branch, Mintlify GitHub integration deploys updates automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- `nothing to commit, working tree clean`: no file changes yet
- `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`: use SSH remote
- local preview errors from non-doc files: ignore those files via `.mintignore`
